# Overview

HELLJUMPER is an arcade-style game inspired by Flappy Bird but with a futuristic theme based on the HELLDIVERS game franchise by [ARROWHEAD Game Studios](https://www.arrowheadgamestudios.com/).

In this game, the player controls a jumper equipped with a jetpack, navigating through a series of hazardous obstacles. The objective is to survive as long as possible while avoiding collisions with barriers.

As a software engineer, this project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with game development using the Python Arcade library. I focused on implementing movement physics, collision detection, and user interaction while ensuring efficient game mechanics.

# Future Work

* Overhaul the start and game over screen (different fonts, colors, ...).
* Swap out the current assets for high-quality, high-resolution graphics.
* Implement a score tracking system and additional difficulty levels (more than just the current barrier speed increase based on the players score).
* Fine tune the background music and the jump sound effect, potentially add more sound effects and control/mute buttons.
